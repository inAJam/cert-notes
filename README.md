# eJPT Notes 

This repository contains my personal notes while preparing for the **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** certification.  

The notes here are not polished guides or official material — they’re **my study references**, covering concepts, commands, and workflows I found useful while practicing.  

## Contents  

- **labs** – Writeups for eJPT official labs
- **Notes** - Practice Notes create as a knowledge base of things I found useful
  - **Practice labs** - Notes and writeups of the trial labs 

## About This Repo  

- Created as a **knowledge base** while studying  
- Updated as I practice labs and exercises  
- Focused on **hands-on penetration testing** concepts  
- May later expand with notes for **future certifications**
